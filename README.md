# Deep Learning with TensorFlow

Practical deep learning focused on understanding training dynamics and model behavior.

## 🎯 Focus Areas
- Neural network fundamentals (tensors, gradients, custom loops)
- CNNs for computer vision
- Transfer learning and fine-tuning
- Training stability and evaluation

## 📁 Structure
- `fundamentals/` - Tensors, autograd, training loops
- `computer_vision/` - CNNs, image classification, data augmentation
- `time_series/` - Sequence models (RNN, LSTM)
- `utils/` - Helper functions

## 💡 Notes
- Models trained on small datasets for clarity
- Emphasis on explainability over performance
- All code rewritten and commented (no copy-paste)
